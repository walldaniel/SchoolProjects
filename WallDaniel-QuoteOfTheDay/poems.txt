I'm a minion xd
Roses are red, I like fruit, Honey, where is my super suit
Roses are red, I need to clean my dentures, Man builts custom kayak, so he could take his dogs on adventures.
You look like a monkey, and smell like one two
Roses are red, some things are scummy, woops you forgot the golden rule, random does not equal funny.
Roses are red, university is long, decisions decisions, all of them wrong
Roses are red, violets are red, Sean is my friend, I drink mountain dew.
Roses are red, my english is fluent, my dissapointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.
Roses are red, violets are red, I though I sucked at poems, then I saw you.
The sun is up, the sky is blue.
